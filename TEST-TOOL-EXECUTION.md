# Tool Execution Test Guide

## 🎯 **What I Fixed**

### 1. **Chat Handler (Server-side)**
- ✅ Added proper logging when LLM returns tool_calls
- ✅ Enhanced tool execution events: `chat:tool_start`, `chat:tool_complete`, `chat:tool_error`
- ✅ Fixed tool results to be sent as structured events instead of raw text
- ✅ Tool invocations are now properly stored and sent in final message

### 2. **Message Rendering (Client-side)**
- ✅ Tool calls are rendered using `EnhancedToolInvocationWithPrism` component
- ✅ Shows Claude-style collapsible Request/Response blocks
- ✅ Real-time status updates during tool execution
- ✅ Proper syntax highlighting for JSON

### 3. **WebSocket Event Flow**
- ✅ `chat:tool_start` - Emitted when tool execution begins
- ✅ `chat:tool_complete` - Emitted with tool results
- ✅ `chat:tool_error` - Emitted if tool fails
- ✅ Client properly updates tool status in real-time

### 4. **Debugging**
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging throughout tool execution pipeline
- ✅ Server logs show: tool_calls detection, execution start/complete, results
- ✅ Client logs show: tool status updates, UI rendering

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### 1. **Open the Application**
```bash
# Make sure all servers are running:
# Terminal 1: ServiceNow MCP Server
# Terminal 2: Backend (npm run dev in server/)
# Terminal 3: Frontend (npm run dev in client/)

# Open: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. **Test Tool Execution**
Try these prompts:

**Simple Tool Test:**
```
Create a catalog item called "Test Laptop Request" in ServiceNow
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ⏳ "Thinking..." indicator appears
2. 🔧 Tool execution starts with collapsible block showing:
   - Header: "servicenow-mcp:create-catalog-item"
   - Request section with syntax-highlighted JSON arguments
   - Executing status (blue border, pulsing animation)
3. ✅ Tool completes with Response section showing result
4. 📝 Assistant provides summary of what was created

**Complex Tool Test:**
```
Create a catalog item for "Office Supplies Request" with variables for:
- Employee Name (text, required)
- Department (dropdown: IT, HR, Finance)
- Item Type (dropdown: Pens, Paper, Folders)
- Quantity (number, 1-100)
- Justification (text area)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Multiple tool calls executed in sequence
2. Each tool gets its own collapsible block
3. Real-time status updates for each tool
4. Final response summarizing all created items

## 🔍 **Debugging**

### Server Logs
Watch the server logs for:
```bash
tail -f server/combined.log | grep -E "(tool|Tool|🔧|✅|❌)"
```

**Expected log entries:**
- `🔧 Processing N tool calls: [tool names]`
- `🚀 Starting tool execution: toolName`
- `✅ Tool execution completed: toolName`

### Client Console
Open browser dev tools and watch for:
- `🔧 Tool started:` - Tool execution begins
- `✅ Tool completed:` - Tool execution finishes
- Tool status updates in real-time

### Visual Verification
✅ **Correct UI (like Claude):**
- Collapsible tool blocks with tool names as headers
- Request section with formatted JSON
- Response section with results
- Status indicators (executing: blue/pulsing, completed: gray, error: red)

❌ **Incorrect UI (old version):**
- Raw JSON text in chat messages
- No collapsible sections
- No syntax highlighting
- No real-time status updates

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### If tools aren't executing:
1. Check ServiceNow MCP server is running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep simple-index.js
   ```

2. Check server logs for MCP connection:
   ```bash
   grep "Connected to ServiceNow MCP server" server/combined.log
   ```

3. Verify tools are loaded:
   ```bash
   grep "Loaded.*ServiceNow MCP tools" server/combined.log
   ```

### If UI shows raw JSON instead of tool blocks:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the message has `toolCalls` array in the stream_complete event
3. Check that `EnhancedToolInvocationWithPrism` component is rendering

### If real-time updates aren't working:
1. Check WebSocket connection in browser dev tools (Network tab)
2. Verify tool events are being emitted by server
3. Check client event handlers are registered properly

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

The fix is working correctly when you see:

1. **LLM requests tools**: Assistant says "I'll create..." and actually executes MCP tools
2. **Claude-style UI**: Collapsible tool blocks with syntax-highlighted JSON
3. **Real-time updates**: Tool status changes from executing → completed in real-time
4. **Proper results**: Tool responses are structured and readable
5. **No raw JSON**: Tool results aren't displayed as plain text in chat

This should now provide the exact same experience as Claude's MCP tool execution!
